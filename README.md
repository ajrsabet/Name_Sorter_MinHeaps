# MinHeap Implementation in Java

This project implements a MinHeap data structure in Java, specifically designed to handle `String` values. The MinHeap class provides methods to insert values, extract the minimum value, and check if the heap is empty. Additionally, a simple command-line interface is provided to interact with the MinHeap.

## Files

- `MinHeap.java`: Contains the implementation of the MinHeap class.
- `main.java`: Contains the main method and a simple menu-driven interface to interact with the MinHeap.

## MinHeap Class

The `MinHeap` class provides the following methods:

- `MinHeap()`: Constructor to initialize the heap.
- `void insert(String value)`: Inserts a new value into the heap.
- `String extractMin()`: Extracts and returns the minimum value from the heap.
- `boolean isEmpty()`: Checks if the heap is empty.

## Main Class

The `main` class provides a simple command-line interface to interact with the MinHeap. The menu options include:

1. Populate the MinHeap with default names.
2. Add a name to the MinHeap.
3. Print the MinHeap in order.
4. Exit the program.

## Usage

To run the program, compile and execute the `main.java` file. You will be presented with a menu to interact with the MinHeap.
